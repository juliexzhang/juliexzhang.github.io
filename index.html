                I am an incoming Junior at Stanford University intending to major in Computer Science and Science, Technology, and Society. 
                For the first two years of my undergraduate studies, I was a student at the University of Washington, studying Computer Science 
                and Political Science, and minoring in Law, Societies, and Justice under the Interdisciplinary Honors Program.
                <br /><br />
                I'm broadly interested in the intersection between Computer Science and law, and specifically interested in XXXX. 
                I've been extremely fortunate to work with and be mentored by Jerry Cao under Shwetak Patel and Jennifer Mankoff of 
                The Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering; Martin Nisser under the Astronautics and Aeronautics 
                Department at the University of Washington; Inyoung Cheong of the Center for Information and Technology Policy at 
                Princeton University; Becky Pettit at the University of Texas at Austin, Population Research Center; and Helen Gaebler 
                at the University of Texas at Austin.
